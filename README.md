Apologies, this project is now in an archived state and will not be receiving updates.

This started as a fun learning and teaching project but I feel it likely only benefits those with malicious intent (credential stuffers) and those looking to make a profit from open source projects without giving back.

I have the code for deobfuscating current Akamai but I will not be releasing it for the reasons listed above. If you do wish to learn from it then message me on Discord (veritas#0001) and I may be able to provide the source to you depending on how I am feeling.
